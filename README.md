Improve your user experience with the Apache Solr search engine for your WordPress website.

## Description ##

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pantheon-systems/solr-power.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pantheon-systems/solr-power)

Search is critical for your site, but the default search for WordPress leaves a lot to be desired. Improve your user experience with the Apache Solr search engine for your WordPress website.

* Fast results, with better accuracy
* Enables faceting on fields such as tags, categories, author, and page type.
* Indexing and faceting on custom fields
* Completely replaces default WordPress search, just install and configure.
* Completely integrated into default WordPress theme and search widget.
* Very developer-friendly: uses the modern [Solarium](http://www.solarium-project.org/) library

## Installation ##

First install the plugin as per normal. If you are installing on Pantheon, you will need to enable the Apache Solr add-on within the Pantheon Site Dashboard before you can enable the plugin.

1. Index your existing content by going to the plugin options screen and selecting the applicable **Actions**:
   - - **Index Searchable Post Types**
2. Search on!
3. See the examples/templates directories for more rich implementation guidelines.

## Development ##

This plugin is under active development on GitHub:

[https://github.com/pantheon-systems/solr-power](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/solr-power)

Please feel free to file issues there. Pull requests are also welcome!

You may notice there are two sets of tests running, on two different services:

* Travis CI runs the [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) test suite against a Solr instance.
* Circle CI runs the [Behat](http://behat.org/) test suite against a Pantheon site, to ensure the plugin's compatibility with the Pantheon platform.

Both of these test suites can be run locally, with a varying amount of setup.

PHPUnit requires the [WordPress PHPUnit test suite](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/automated-testing/phpunit/), and access to a database with name `wordpress_test`. If you haven't already configured the test suite locally, you can run `bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_test root '' localhost`. You'll also need access to a running Solr instance, in order to run the unit tests against Solr.

Behat requires a Pantheon site with Solr enabled. Once you've created the site, you'll need [install Terminus](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus#installation), and set the `TERMINUS_TOKEN`, `TERMINUS_SITE`, and `TERMINUS_ENV` environment variables. Then, you can run `./bin/behat-prepare.sh` to prepare the site for the test suite.
